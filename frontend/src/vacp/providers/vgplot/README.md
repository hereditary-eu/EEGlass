# @vacp/vgplot

## Purpose

First-class VACP integration for vgplot (VGPlot runtime).

This provider maps vgplot’s runtime semantics (*View*s, interactors, *Selection*s) into VACP capabilities/state/actions.

## When to use

- You build visualizations with vgplot runtime and want them to be agent-ready.
- You want semantic actions for selection/interaction instead of pixel automation.

## Conceptual model

Treat this provider as a compiler layer:

- vgplot runtime entities become stable refs and graph nodes,
- vgplot interaction semantics become state snapshot entries,
- semantic actions are registered for intent-level operations.

## Minimal usage

Install VACP after rendering:

```ts
import { installVacpOnVgplot } from "@vacp/vgplot";

installVacpOnVgplot(plot, svg, {
  appId: "vacp-examples",
  viewId: "vgplot/crossfilter",
  plotId: "plot-0",
  title: "Crossfilter (Flights)",
});
```

Runnable example:

- `packages/examples/vgplot-gallery`
