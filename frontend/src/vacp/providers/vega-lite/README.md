# @vacp/vega-lite

## Purpose

VACP provider for interactive Vega-Lite/Vega views.

This provider connects to a Vega _View_ and exposes a stable VACP bridge with capabilities, state, and semantic actions.

## When to use

- You render Vega-Lite (or Vega) and want agent-ready semantics.
- You want to control *Param*s and *Selection*s through semantic actions.

## Conceptual model

This provider maps the Vega runtime into VACP:

- _View_/_Param_/_Selection_ entities become graph nodes with stable refs,
- _Param_ and _Selection_ values appear in the state snapshot,
- semantic actions set *Param*s and clear *Selection*s.

## Minimal usage

After you have a Vega _View_ (for example from `vega-embed`):

```ts
import { installVacpOnVegaLiteView } from "@vacp/vega-lite";

installVacpOnVegaLiteView({
  root,
  view,
  spec,
  options: {
    appId: "vacp-examples",
    viewId: "vega-lite/example",
    vizId: "example",
    title: "Example",
  },
});
```

Runnable example:

- `packages/examples/vega-lite-gallery`
